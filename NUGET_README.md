A simple but neat logging library for .NET 7.0 and higher. It includes XML documentation!

The library is built with extensibility in mind, by adding a "sink" system where each `Log` call is sent to all sinks for processing instead of centralizing
everything into the main logger class.

It comes with 3 default logging sinks:
- Console
- Debugger
- File

**Important!**
All of the built-in sinks are thread-safe, but the library doesn't enforce this. Use third party sinks with caution!

## ü§î Usage
Create the needed sinks and their configurations and pass them to the constructor to `MatchaLogger`.  
Adding or removing sinks at runtime is not allowed, but this may change in a future release.

You may change a sink's configuration at runtime by keeping a reference to it.  
Matcha will automatically dispose any sinks that implement `IDisposable` when Matcha itself is disposed.

## üñåÔ∏è Custom Sinks
Creating a custom sink requires you to implement `IMatchaSink<out T>`, where `T` may be any
class, record or struct that inherits from `SinkConfig`.

`WriteLogAsync` may be marked as async, and the sink can optionally also implement `IDisposable` if it
has resources that need to be disposed.

**Tip!**
Implement a `SemaphoreSlim` for thread safety, and release it inside a `finally` block.
This will prevent deadlocks if an error occurs during logging.
